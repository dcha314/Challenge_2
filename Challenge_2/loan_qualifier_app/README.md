# Project Title

This program prompts users for a csv file with current bank information to see if they qualify for a high quality loan. The program will then prompt the user to see if they would like to save their data as a CSV file. If no such loans exist, the program will notify the user and exit. Else, should the user qualify for any loans, the program will offer the user to save their information and will exit otherwise. The program will allow the user to specify the name for their file path, should they choose to save their information.
